# Open guides in your preferred markdown viewer
# or use Jupyter to view them as notebooks
jupyter lab
```

### Sequential Learning
For comprehensive learning, read the guides in order:

1. Start with `01_jupyter_basics_guide.md`
2. Continue with `02_jupyterlab_interface_guide.md`
3. Learn `03_magic_commands_guide.md`
4. Explore `04_interactive_widgets_guide.md`
5. Study `05_best_practices_guide.md`
6. Master `06_advanced_features_guide.md`
7. Finish with `07_deployment_guide.md`

### Converting to Notebooks
You can convert the markdown guides to Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning:

```bash
# Install pandoc if not already installed
conda install pandoc

# Convert markdown to notebook
pandoc 01_jupyter_basics_guide.md -o 01_jupyter_basics_guide.ipynb
```

df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()

# 3. Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df.plot(kind='hist')

# 4. Model Building
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# 5. Results Documentation
print("Model accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Interactive Visualization
```python
import ipywidgets as widgets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create interactive slider
slider = widgets.FloatSlider(value=1.0, min=0.1, max=5.0, step=0.1)

# Create interactive plot
def plot_function(amplitude):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = amplitude * np.sin(x)
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()

widgets.interactive(plot_function, amplitude=slider)
```

### Magic Commands Example
```python
# Line magic for timing
%timeit [x**2 for x in range(1000)]

# Cell magic for profiling
%%prun
import numpy as np
data = np.random.randn(10000)
result = np.mean(data)

# System commands
!pip install pandas
!ls -la
```
